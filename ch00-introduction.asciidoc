An étude, according to Wikipedia, is "an instrumental musical composition, usually short and of considerable difficulty, usually designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill."

What are Études for Erlang?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you
can compose (write) in Erlang.The programs will usually be short,
and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular
Erlang programming concept. Unlike musical études, these programs have not been
designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to
stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find
in the book http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do[Introducing Erlang].
