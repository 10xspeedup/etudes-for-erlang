Étude 1-1: Experimenting with Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first chapter of
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do[Introducing Erlang]
encourages you to play around with the interacative +erl+ system.
In this étude, keep using +erl+, but purposely make errors.

Try leaving out parentheses in arithmetic expressions. Try putting
numbers next to each other without an operator between them.
Try adding +"adam"+ to +12+. Make up variable names that you are sure
Erlang wouldn't ever accept.

That way, you'll get a feel for the sort of error messages
Erlang produces and not be as baffled when you get errors that
you aren't expecting.
